  <h3>Expecting Arguments</h3>

  <script type="syntaxhighlighter" class="brush: ruby">
    expect(double).to receive(:msg).with(*args)
  </script>

  <p>Arguments that are passed to with are compared with actual arguments received using ==. In cases in which you want to specify things about the arguments rather than the arguments themselves, you can use any of the matchers that ship with rspec-expectations.</p>

  <script type="syntaxhighlighter" class="brush: ruby">
    expect(double).to receive(:msg).with(no_args())
    expect(double).to receive(:msg).with(any_args())
    expect(double).to receive(:msg).with(1, kind_of(Numeric), "b") #2nd argument can be any kind of Numeric
    expect(double).to receive(:msg).with(1, boolean(), "b") #2nd argument can be true or false
    expect(double).to receive(:msg).with(1, /abc/, "b") #2nd argument can be any String matching the submitted Regexp
    expect(double).to receive(:msg).with(1, anything(), "b") #2nd argument can be anything at all
    expect(double).to receive(:msg).with(1, duck_type(:abs, :div), "b")
                        #2nd argument can be object that responds to #abs and #div
