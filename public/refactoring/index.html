  <h2>Refactoring</h2>
  <p>
    Refactoring is the process of changing a software system in such a way that it does not alter the external behavior of the code yet improves its internal structure.
  </p>
</section><section id="codesmell-is" class="slide">
  <h2>Code smell</h2>
  <p>
    Code smell is any symptom in the source code of a program that possibly indicates a deeper problem. Code smells are usually not bugs they are not technically incorrect and don't currently prevent the program from functioning. Instead, they indicate weaknesses in design that may be slowing down development or increasing the risk of bugs or failures in the future.
  </p>
</section><section id="the-refactoring-cycle" class="slide">
  <h2>The Refactoring Cycle</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Start with working, tested code while the design can be simplified</li>
    <li>Choose the worst smell</li>
    <li>Apply the refactoring</li>
    <li>Check that the tests still pass</li>
  </ul>

<section id="duplicated-code" class="slide">
  <h2>Duplicated Code</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>The easy form: Two fragments of code look nearly identical.</li>
    <li>The hard form: Two fragments of code have nearly identical effects (at any conceptual level).</li>
  </ul>
  <h3>Problems</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Size: The code is bigger than it has to be, with more to understand.</li>
    <li>Flexibility: The change may have to be done in multiple places.</li>
    <li>Communication: The reader must decide whether two things are really expressing one concept, and whether any differences are significant.</li>
  </ul>
  <h3>What to Do</h3>
  <ul><li>If in same class <a href="#extract-method-before">Extract Method</a></li>
    <li>If in two subclasses <a href="#extract-method-before">Extract Method</a> or <a href="#pull-up-method-before">Pull Up Method</a></li>
    <li>If not identical <a href="#form-template-method-before">Form Template Method</a> or <a href="#substitute-algorithm-before">Subtitute Algorithm</a></li>

  </ul>
</section><section id="long-method" class="slide">
  <h2>Long Method</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>A method has a large number of lines. (We’re immediately suspicious of any method with more than five lines.)</li>
  </ul>
  <h3>Problems</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Flexibility: A Long Method is guaranteed to be a Greedy Method at least two responsibilities are coupled together in one place, which in turn leads to Divergent Change.</li>
    <li>Testability: It can be difficult to isolate individual behaviors of a Long Method for testing; and if a method does too much it may also be difficult to create fixtures that contain enough context for the method to work properly.</li>
  </ul>
  <h3>What to Do</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>If no prob with params use <a href="#extract-method-before">Extract Method</a> to break up the method into smaller pieces. Look for comments or white space delineating interesting fragments. You want to extract methods that are semantically meaningful, not just introduce a function call every seven lines.</li>
    <li>If the method doesn't separate easily into pieces, consider <a href="#replace-method-with-method-object-before">Replace Method with Method Object</a> to turn the method into a separate object, or <a href="#replace-temp-with-query-before">Replace Temp with Query</a></li>
    <li>If has loops and conditionals <a href="#decompose-conditional-before">Decompose Conditional</a> or Replace Loop with <a href="#collection-closure-method-before">Collection Closure Method</a></li>
  </ul>
</section><section id="long-parameter-list" class="slide">
  <h2>Long Parameter List</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>A method has more than one or two parameters.</li>
    <li>A method yields more than one or two objects to an associated block.</li>
  </ul>
  <h3>Problems</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Simplicity: A Long Parameter List often indicates that a method has more than one responsibility. Sometimes the parameters have no meaningful grouping—they don’t go together. In such cases it may be that the method, or the objects it uses, doesn’t represent a meaningful and cohesive abstraction in the problem domain.</li>
    <li>Flexibility: A Long Parameter List represents a large number of pieces of shared information between the caller and called code. If either changes, the parameter list is likely to need changing too.</li>
    <li>Communication: A lot of parameters represent a lot to remember—the programmer has to remember not only what objects to pass, but in which order. More suc- cinct APIs are easier and quicker to use.</li>
  </ul>
  <h3>What to Do</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>If a parameter's value can be obtained from another object use <a href="#replace-parameter-with-method-before">Replace Parameter with Method</a>.</li>
    <li>If the parameters come from a single object, try <a href="#preserve-whole-object-before">Preserve Whole Object</a>.</li>
    <li>If the data is not from one logical object, you still might group them via <a href="#introduce-parameter-object-before">Introduce Parameter Object</a>.</li>
    <li>Otherwise make clearer with <a href="#introduce-named-parameter-before">Introduce Named Parameter</a></li>
  </ul>
</section><section id="uncommunicative-name" class="slide">
  <h2>Uncommunicative Name</h2>
  A name doesn't communicate its intent well enough. Examples of this can include:
  <ul>
    <li>One or two character names (mn, ts, sc).</li>
    <li>Names with vowels omitted (lgn, psh).</li>
    <li>Numbered variables (pane1, pane2).</li>
    <li>Odd abbreviations (par, dis, mov).</li>
    <li>Variable names that reflect their type rather than their purpose or role (i_count, s_name).</li>
    <li>Misleading names.</li>
  </ul>
  <h3>Problems</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Communication: Poor names deceive the reader; they make it harder to build a mental picture of what's going on, and they can be misinterpreted. They also hurt the flow of reading as the reader must slow down to interpret the names.</li>
    <li>Flexibility: Very short names can be difficult to change, even with automated refactoring tools.</li>
  </ul>
  <h3>What to Do</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Use <a href="#rename-method-before">Rename Method</a> (or field, constant, etc.) to give it a better name</li>
  </ul>
</section><section id="comments" class="slide">
  <h2>Comments</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>The code contains a comment.</li>
  </ul>
  <h3>Problems</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Flexibility: Any comment that explains the code must be kept in step if the code is changed.</li>
    <li>Duplication: Most comments can be reflected just as well in the code itself. For example, the goal of a method can often be communicated as well through its name as it can through a comment.</li>
    <li>Communication: Comments that say something slightly different than the code create cognitive drag or even mistrust and slow the reader down.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Don’t delete comments that are pulling their own weight such as rdoc API documentation.</p>
  <h3>What to Do</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>When a comment explains a code fragment, you can often use <a href="#extract-method-before">Extract Method</a> to pull the fragment out into a separate method. The comment will often suggest a name for the new method.</li>
    <li>When a comment explains what a method does (better than the method's name!), use <a href="#rename-method-before">Rename Method</a> using the comment as the basis of the new name.</li>
    <li>When a comment explains preconditions, consider using <a href="#introduce-assertion-before">Introduce Assertion</a> to replace the comment with code.</li>
  </ul>
</section><section id="large-module" class="slide">
  <h2>Large Class or Module</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>A class or module has a large number of instance variables, methods, or just lines of code.</li>
  </ul>
  <h3>Problems</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Testability: A Large Module is usually difficult to test, either because it depends on many other modules or because it is difficult or time-consuming to create instances in isolation.</li>
    <li>Flexibility: The module represents too many responsibilities folded together that is, every Large Module is also a Greedy Module.</li>
  </ul>
  <h3>What to Do</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>To break up the module further, use <a href="#extract-class-before">Extract Class</a> or <a href="#extract-module-before">Extract Module</a> if you can identify a new piece that has part of this module's responsibilities</li>
    <li>Also will be useful <a href="#replace-type-code-with-polymorphism-before">Replace Type Code with Polymorphism</a>, <a href="#replace-type-code-with-module-extension-before">Replace Type Code with Module Extension</a>, <a href="#replace-type-code-with-state-strategy-before">Replace Type Code with State Strategy</a></li>
    <li>Very often a review of the module reveals a composite of other smells, such as Long Methods, Data Clumps, and Temporary Fields; fix these smells first.</li>
  </ul>
</section><!-- Divergent Change -->
<section id="shotgun-surgery" class="slide">
  <h2>Shotgun Surgery</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Making a simple change requires you to change several classes or modules.</li>
  </ul>
  <h3>Problems</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Communication: You change a single decision and you have to change several classes, which probably means that the decision doesn't have a name, and consequently the application's design isn't being clearly communicated. That will cause current and future developers to need to search the code more, which may in turn lead to defects.</li>
    <li>Flexibility: It probably also means that the decision hasn't been isolated from other decisions. So some modules may be harder to test than necessary, and some modules may churn for longer, perhaps never stabilizing.</li>
  </ul>
  <h3>What to Do</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Identify the class or module that should own the group of changes. It may be an existing module, or you may need to use <a href="#extract-module-before">Extract Module</a> to create a new one.</li>
    <li>Use <a href="#move-field-before">Move Field</a> and Move Method to put the functionality onto the chosen module. After the module not chosen is simple enough, you may be able to use Inline Module to eliminate it.</li>
  </ul>
</section><section id="feature-envy" class="slide">
  <h2>Feature Envy</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>A code fragment references another object more often than it references itself.</li>
    <li>Several clients do the same series of manipulations on a particular type of object.</li>
  </ul>
  <h3>Problems</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Communication: Code that "belongs" on one class but is located in another can be hard to find and may upset the System of Names in the host class.</li>
    <li>Flexibility: A code fragment that is in the wrong class creates couplings that may not be natural within the application's domain and a loss of cohesion in the unwilling host class.</li>
    <li>Duplication: Existing functionality that is difficult to find is also easy to miss, which in turn may lead to it being written more than once.</li>
  </ul>
  <h3>What to Do</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>If the envious code fragment is not isolated, use <a href="#extract-method-before">Extract Method</a> to pull it into its own method.</li>
    <li>Look for the class of the object that is referenced most and use <a href="#move-field-before">Move Field</a> and Move Method to put the actions on the correct class.</li>
  </ul>
</section> <!-- Move Method -->
<section id="data-clump" class="slide">
  <h2>Data Clump</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>The same two or three items frequently appear together in classes and parameter lists.</li>
    <li>A group of instance variable names start or end with similar substrings.</li>
  </ul>
  <h3>Problems</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Duplication: The recurrence of the items often means there is duplicate code spread around to handle them.</li>
    <li>Abstraction: There may be a missing concept, making the system harder to understand.</li>
  </ul>
  <h3>What to Do</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>If the items are instance variables in a class, use <a href="#extract-class-before">Extract Class</a> to pull them into a new class.</li>
    <li>If the values are together in method signatures, use <a href="#introduce-parameter-object-before">Introduce Parameter Object</a>, <a href="#replace-array-with-object-before">Replace Array with Object</a> to extract the new object.</li>
  </ul>
</section><section id="special-case" class="slide">
  <h2>Special Case</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Complex if statements</li>
    <li>Guard clauses checks for particular values before doing work (especially comparisons to constants)</li>
  </ul>
  <h3>Problems</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Communication: A Special Case increases the amount the reader has to hold in his head while attempting to understand a code fragment.</li>
  </ul>
  <h3>What to Do</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>If the conditionals are taking the place of polymorphism, <a href="#replace-type-code-with-polymorphism-before">Replace Conditional with Polymorphism</a> or <a href="#replace-type-code-with-module-extension-before">Replace Type Code with Module Extension</a> or <a href="#replace-type-code-with-state-strategy-before">Replace Type Code with State Strategy</a>. You may find things become more clear if you first use Extract Method on the clauses.</li>
    <li>If used once <a href="#replace-parameter-with-method-before">Replace Parameter with Method</a></li>
    <li>If one branch is null <a href="#introduce-null-object-before">Introduce Null Object</a></li>
    <li>If have dificult conditions use <a href="#decompose-conditional-before">Decompose conditional</a>, <a href="#substitute-algorithm-before">Substitute Algorithm</a>, <a href="#replace-method-with-method-object-before">Replace Method With Method Object</a></li>
    <li>If the if and else clauses are similar enough, you may be able to rewrite them so that the same code fragment can generate the proper results for each case; then the conditional can be eliminated.</li>
  </ul>
</section><section id="control-coupling" class="slide">
  <h2>Control Coupling</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>A method or block checks the value of a parameter in order to decide which execution path to take.</li>
    <li>A method's name includes a word such as "or."</li>
  </ul>
  <h3>Problems</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Duplication: Control Coupling is a kind of duplication, because the caller already knows which path should be taken.</li>
    <li>Flexibility: The caller and callee are coupled together - any change to the possible values of the controlling parameter must be reflected on both sides.</li>
    <li>Simplicity: The called method is probably also a Greedy Method, because it includes at least two different code paths.</li>
  </ul>
  <h3>What to Do</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Use <a href="#extract-method-before">Extract Method</a> to strip the controlled method down to the bare skeleton.</li>
    <li>Then use <a href="#inline-method-before">Inline Method</a> to push the responsibility back up to the caller(s).</li>
    <li>Repeat all the way up the call stack to the source of the control value.</li>
  </ul>
</section><section id="greedy-method" class="slide">
  <h2>Greedy Method</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>A method does more than one job.</li>
    <li>A method has “and” in its name.</li>
    <li>The body of a method includes code at several different levels of abstraction.</li>
  </ul>
  <h3>Problems</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Communication: A code fragment that has two responsibilities intertwined is harder to read, and harder to name.</li>
    <li>Flexibility: If one of the method's responsibilities must change, or has a defect, you often have to work hard to sidestep the method's other responsibilities - it can therefore be a challenge to avoid breaking other code.</li>
    <li>Testability: A method that does two things will be harder to test than if the responsi - bilities were separated.</li>
  </ul>
  <h3>What to Do</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Consider the approaches todealing with a <a href="#long-method">Long Method</a> they will often work here just as well. Use <a href="#extract-method-before">Extract Method</a> to hide detail behind an intention revealing name.</li>

  </ul>
</section><section id="divergent-change" class="slide">
  <h2>Divergent Change</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>You find yourself changing the same module for different reasons.</li>
  </ul>
  <h3>Problems</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Flexibility: If a module needs to change for many different reasons, you may quickly find that two developers need to change it at the same time. So the module becomes a bottleneck, slowing down progress.</li>
    <li>Abstraction: Worse, a module with high "churn" may never stabilize, and so may never come to reliably represent a useful domain abstraction.</li>
  </ul>
  <h3>What to Do</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>If the module has too many (i.e., more than one) responsibilities use <a href="#extract-class-before">Extract Class</a> or <a href="#extract-module-before">Extract Module</a> to separate the responsibilities.</li>
    <li>If several classes share the same decisions or variation points, you may be able to consolidate them into new classes (e.g., by <a href="#hide-delegate-before">Hide Delegate</a>, <a href="#pull-up-method-before">Pull Up Method</a>, <a href="#form-template-method">Form Template Method</a>, Extract Superclass or Extract Subclass) or extract a common module to serve as a mix-in. In the limit, these extracted classes or modules can form a layer (e.g., a persistence layer).</li>
  </ul>
</section><section id="dead-code" class="slide">
  <h2>Dead Code</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>A variable, parameter, code fragment, method, module, or class is not used anywhere (perhaps other than in tests)</li>
  </ul>
  <h3>Problems</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Size: Dead Code adds to the application’s size, and thus to the amount of code that must be understood by developers and maintainers.</li>
    <li>Communication: It isn’t always obvious when code is dead, and so the reader may take it as having a bearing on the behavior of his software. Indeed, Dead Code that is also incorrect or invalid may lead the developer seriously astray.</li>
    <li>Flexibility: All code has dependencies on other code; but Dead Code may create dependencies where otherwise there would be none. These unnecessary couplings may, in turn, slow the pace of change for the code in these areas.</li>
  </ul>
  <h3>What to Do</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Delete the unused code and any associated tests.</li>
    <li>The code you just deleted may have been the only client of some other code, so that in turn is now dead. Continue checking and deleting until you find no more Dead Code.</li>
  </ul>
</section><section id="lazy-class" class="slide">
  <h2>Lazy Class</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>A class isn't doing much its parents, children, or clients seem to be doing all the associated work and there isn’t enough behavior left in the class to justify its continued existence.</li>
  </ul>
  <h3>Problems</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Simplicity: Every additional class in the application represents something extra to understand, and extra code to navigate while following a flow.</li>
    <li>Communication: A Lazy Class also occupies one of the names in your domain space, without paying for that usage.</li>
  </ul>
  <h3>When to Leave It</h3>
  <p>Sometimes, a Lazy Class is present to communicate intent. You may have to balance communication versus simplicity in your design; and when communication wins, leave the Lazy Class in place.</p>
  <h3>What to Do</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>If parents or children of the class seem like the right place for the class’ behavior, fold it into one of them via <i>Collapse Hierarchy</i>.</li>
    <li>Otherwise, fold its behavior into its caller via <a href="#inline-class-before">Inline Class</a>.</li>
  </ul>
</section><section id="temporary-field" class="slide">
  <h2>Temporary Field</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>An instance variable is set only at certain times, and it is nil (or unused) at other times.</li>
  </ul>
  <h3>Problems</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Abstraction: Parts of the object change at different rates, and the class spends effort coordinating the changes. This suggests there is an implicit concept that can be brought out (with its own lifetime).</li>
  </ul>
  <h3>When to Leave It</h3>
  <p>It may not be worth the trouble of creating a new class if it doesn’t represent a useful abstraction.</p>
  <h3>What to Do</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Use <a href="#extract-class-before">Extract Class</a>, moving over the fields and any related code.</li>
    <li>Also <a href="#introduce-null-object-before">Introduce Null Object</a>, <a href="#replace-method-with-method-object-before">Replace Method with Method Object</a>, <a href="#replace-temp-with-query-before">Replace Temp with Query</a></li>

  <ul>

    <li>Use <a href="#hide-delegate-before">Hide Delegate</a> and <a href="#inline-class-before">Inline Class</a> to make the caller depend only on the object at the head of the chain.
